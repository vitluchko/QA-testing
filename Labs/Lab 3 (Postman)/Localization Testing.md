1. <h4>User Interface Localization:</h4>

* Change the language settings of the operating system or Postman application to the target language.
* Verify that all user interface elements, including menus, buttons, labels, and error messages, are correctly translated.
* Check that the layout and alignment of UI elements are appropriate for the target language, considering factors such as text expansion or contraction.
* Verify that the localized UI is culturally appropriate and does not contain offensive or inappropriate content.

2. <h4>Input and Output Localization:</h4>

* Enter localized text data in various fields, such as headers, request parameters, and body.
* Verify that the application correctly handles and processes localized input data.
* Ensure that special characters, accents, and diacritical marks are supported and displayed accurately.
* Validate that the application produces localized output, such as response messages or error notifications, in the expected language.

3. <h4>Date and Time Localization:</h4>

* Configure the system or Postman application to use different date and time formats specific to the target locale.
* Verify that date and time fields are displayed in the expected format.
* Test the application's behavior when dealing with date and time calculations, comparisons, and conversions in the localized context.
* Check the accuracy of localized date and time-related functionalities, such as time zone conversions or daylight saving time adjustments.

4. <h4>Number and Currency Localization:</h4>

* Test the application's handling of localized numeric formats, decimal separators, and digit grouping symbols.
* Validate that numerical calculations, rounding, and formatting follow the rules of the target locale.
* Verify the correct display of localized currency symbols and proper handling of currency conversions, if applicable.
* Check for consistency in the localization of numeric data across different areas of the application.

5. <h4>Language-Dependent Features:</h4>

* Verify the behavior of language-dependent features, such as code syntax highlighting or auto-completion in the Postman script editor.
* Test the support for non-Latin character sets or writing systems specific to the target language.
* Check the correct display and functionality of localized documentation, tooltips, or help resources.

6. <h4>Locale-Sensitive Data:</h4>

* Test the application's handling of locale-specific data formats, such as addresses, phone numbers, postal codes, or units of measurement.
* Verify that the application accurately formats and validates locale-specific data according to the rules of the target locale.
* Test scenarios involving locale-specific data, such as address validation or unit conversion, to ensure correct behavior.

7. <h4>Localization Compatibility:</h4>

* Ensure that the application functions correctly when the system's regional settings are changed to different locales.
* Test compatibility with different operating systems or platforms, as certain localization features may vary across environments.
* Verify that the application does not introduce any regressions or issues when switching between languages or locales.
