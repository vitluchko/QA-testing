1. <h4>Test API Request:</h4>

* Send a GET request to a specific API endpoint.
* Verify that the response status code is 200 (OK).
* Check that the response contains the expected data.
* Test with different input parameters and verify the corresponding output.
 
2. <h4>Test API Response:</h4>

* Send a POST request with valid input data to create a new resource.
* Verify that the response status code is 201 (Created).
* Check that the response contains the newly created resource's ID or relevant information.
* Send a GET request to retrieve the created resource and verify its correctness.

3. <h4>Test Authentication:</h4>

* Send a request that requires authentication without providing valid credentials.
* Verify that the response status code is 401 (Unauthorized).
* Send the request with valid credentials and ensure the response status code is 200 (OK).
 
4. <h4>Test Headers and Cookies:</h4>

* Send a request with custom headers and verify that the server receives and processes them correctly.
* Set a cookie value in a request and ensure it is stored and sent back in subsequent requests.

5. <h4>Test File Upload and Download:</h4>

* Send a POST request with a file attached and verify that it is successfully uploaded.
* Download a file by sending a GET request and verify that the downloaded file matches the expected content.

6. <h4>Test Error Handling:</h4>

* Send a request with incorrect input data and verify that the server returns an appropriate error response.
* Test different error scenarios, such as invalid endpoints or missing parameters, and ensure the responses are handled correctly.

7. <h4>Test Environment Variables:</h4>

* Define environment variables in Postman.
* Use the variables in requests and verify that the correct values are substituted during runtime.

8. <h4>Test Collection Runner:</h4>

* Create a collection with multiple requests and test them using the Collection Runner.
* Verify that all requests execute successfully and produce the expected results.

9. <h4>Test Integration with Newman:</h4>

* Export the collection and run it using Newman command-line tool.
* Verify that the exported collection runs without errors and produces the expected results.

10. <h4>Test Automation:</h4>

* Write automated tests using Postman's built-in test scripts or a testing framework like Newman or Jest.
* Automate the execution of test suites and verify the expected outcomes.
